0,"I've owned multiple pairs of AirPods over the years—standard, Pro, and even the Max version. Up until now, my favorite had always been the first-generation AirPods Pro. But after debating whether or not to get the second-generation AirPods Pro, I finally took the plunge, and I’m glad I did. Here’s what I’ve noticed after using them.The biggest improvement I noticed right away was the noise cancellation. I spend a lot of time in loud environments, whether it's in a workshop or just crowded spaces, and the V2’s ANC works much better at filtering out background noise. There’s also this new feature where it seems to adjust based on voices around you, something that wasn’t in the first version. It’s made a noticeable difference when I need to focus or block out distractions.In terms of sound, I wouldn’t say it’s a night-and-day difference, but the bass feels more punchy in this new version. The sound is crisper overall, but unless you’re really paying attention, the upgrade might seem subtle.One of the best things about the AirPods Pro (V2) is the improvement in battery life. I’m getting almost double the usage time compared to the first-gen. Plus, Apple finally switched to USB-C charging, which feels long overdue. The wireless charging has also been more reliable—no more overheating or endless charging cycles like I had with the older model.Something I always look for in Apple products is quality, and I’m happy to report that it’s still there. These AirPods feel sturdy, and they work flawlessly with my other Apple devices. Pairing them is almost instant, and the upgraded FindMy feature has been a lifesaver. The fact that the charging case can now make a noise when lost is incredibly useful—something the previous model didn’t offer, which was a frustrating limitation.AppleCare+ remains as good as ever, and I continue to recommend it for all Apple products. This time around, they’ve made it simpler by offering an option to bundle it directly with the purchase, so you don’t have to activate it later on. It saves you the hassle, and it ensures that you're covered from day one.For me, the most crucial factor is how much I use these. I wear my AirPods a lot—whether I’m listening to music or just using them for noise cancellation during daily tasks. If you’re like me and have these in your ears for hours on end, the V2 is absolutely worth the upgrade. But if you’re not using them constantly, you might want to hold off for the next version that’s likely coming soon.In conclusion, while the second-generation AirPods Pro might not be a massive leap in sound quality for the average listener, the combination of better noise cancellation, battery life, and new features make it a solid upgrade. For regular users like me, it's definitely worth the investment, but casual users might be just fine sticking with their current pair.

1,"First, please comment if you have any questions and I would love to respond to help!I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. I have noticed recently how good the sound quality is. It’s stunning. Sometimes I still prefer my Maxes for certain listening experiences or if I’m heavily invested in a movie or I have a long flight, but the quality on the 2nd gen pros is so crisp. Some pitches you can notice are superior to that of the Maxes. In terms of listen, Maxes win, but it’s so damn close. AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, discrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!

2,"I never take the time to write reviews because why spend so much time on something that will ultimately have no effect on my life? Well in this case, these Airpods have met and exceeded every single one of my expectations and I figured that was worth writing about.Important disclaimers:- OF COURSE this is a subjective opinion, because that is all a review is. Take it with a grain of salt.- Different products work better or worse for different people, it's just that simple.- When talking about noise cancelling headphones, it's important to consider them for what they are, not what we think they SHOULD be.THE FIT:OKAY. I am someone who has very small ear cannals. I have spent years trying to find earbuds that fit my ears comfortably. Silicone in-ear tips have always been extremely uncomfortable for me. That being said, I did own the first gen Airpods Pro for a couple of years before buying these Airpods 4. I wanted earbuds that I could exercise with, use for commuting, and use for blocking out sound when I'm at school or on an airplane. The airpods pro fit the bill, but I could only wear them for short periods of time before they would start to seriously hurt. On top of that, they would always slowly come out of my ears. It didn't matter what size of eartips I used. My ears are just NOT made for in-ear silicone tips. BUT THESE AIRPODS 4!!! Holy smokes they are so comfortable. They never fall out. I can wear them for hours at a time and not even notice them. I haven't worn a pair of Airpods this comfortable since the gen 2 Airpods. The 3's didn't work for me either, but somehow apple really cooked up the ideal fit for these Airpods 4.THE NOISE CANCELLATION:Okay. Obviously, these are NOT going to have the same level of noise reduction as in-ear earbuds because there is no seal created by any silicone tips. If Airpods Pros and silicone tips have always worked for you, just buy those. However, considering that the noise cancellation in these Airpods is ALL driven by software, I have been extremely impressed with the results. It reduces the white noise of annoying sounds like public trains, airplanes, etc. very effectively. While voices and other louder sounds aren't cancelled completely, when music is playing through the earbuds these noises are quite enough to hardly notice. For me, that's enough. I don't need complete silence, I have my over-ear noise cancelling headphones for that.THE SOUND QUALITY:When I say that I was blown away the first time I listened to music on these Airpods, I was NOT kidding. The amount of bass that they managed to pack in to such small, open-eared earbuds is frankly impressive. The sound profile allows for an incredible listening experience no matter what genre of music you listen to (I listen to a wide range of pop, folk, indie, and rap primarily).THE OVERALL VERDICT:These Airpods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation are exactly as I expected them to be. They fit extremely well, the ANC is very acceptable for what they are, and they sound amazing. That's not to mention the TINY case that they come in, making them so easy to slip anywhere. I have been looking for a solid pair of earbuds with ANC that work with my ears for the longest time now. I'm happy to say that these are everything I've ever wanted. If you have had issues with silicone ear-tip earbuds fitting you properly, then these are definitely worth a shot!

3,"After upgrading from the 2nd generation, I am quite happy with these Airpods 4.  I was nervous about the fit since the 2nd generation is noticeably smaller than the 4s but the fit is perfectly fine. I do wear some third party ear hooks when I'm out and about in these as a precaution but they feel quite secure without them. I was scared they would feel heavy after I am used to both Airpods 2nd gen and wired small earpods but they're so light weight and incredibly comfortable. Even though I was content with the older Airpods sound quality these just sound so much more punchy and it's a great experience at a decent price. I was also impressed with the ANC. I like the ANC version because it allows me to charge my case with my watch charger if I don't have an available USB C cable, and the Find My where it plays a sound helps.

4,"These are the best AirPods. Don’t get me wrong, I have AirPods Pro 2 and they still sound a bit better and have better noise cancellation, but I now wear these a lot more time than my Pro 2. Reason is simple, these are more comfy, I don’t feel a thing wearing these. And they’re super secure on my ears. Of course it depends on your ear shape—but if these fit you well, they are amazing. Good enough noise cancellation, fantastic sound, literally equal-to-no-headphone level transparency mode.Simply put, I already have AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Max (and I’m not giving those up), but I’m still keeping these, since they’re that good. They’re now an indispensable addition to my AirPods family. For anyone, they’ll become your fav pair of headphones in no time.

5,"First of all, I would like to say that people who leave low star reviews by directly comparing it to Airpods Pro 2, are very misleading for 2 reasons:1. Many people, myself included, dislike silicone tips and avoid the Pro versions for this reason. This model seems specifically designed for that audience;2. This model isn’t an upgrade to Pro - it’s an upgrade to Airpods 3, therefore I do not understand why it is compared to completely unrelated model.DeliveryThe box came undamaged and unopened. Verified that the product is original. Make sure to choose the model which is both sold and shipped by Amazon.AirpodsAs for my experience, the AirPods exceeded my expectations. The fit is excellent, I had no issues with the previous models but it seems to fit a bit better for me. They stay secure even during activities like running.The most impressive thing - ANC. I was pleasantly surprised at its quality, especially given the lack of silicone tips to passively block external noise. I live on a very busy street and it completely blocked all the noise. Gesture controls are surprisingly useful as well.Set up took 2 seconds - opened the case and connected immediately. I also like that the case is smaller, which makes it easier to carry around. While it doesn’t come with a charging cable, it supports USB-C and can be charged with an Apple Watch charger as well.In summary, if you’re not a fan of silicone tips and want a model with ANC, I highly recommend these.

6,"I've been using the Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) for a few weeks now, and they’ve exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is fantastic, with well-balanced bass and crisp highs. The spatial audio feature adds a whole new dimension to music and movies, making the experience more immersive.Comfort-wise, these earbuds fit securely in my ears without causing any discomfort, even during extended use. The battery life is also impressive—I've been able to get a full day’s use on a single charge with room to spare. The case is compact and easy to carry, and the MagSafe charging is a nice touch for convenience.

9,"At first I didn’t know what AirPods to buy but I asked my friend so he suggested these AirPods 3rd gen So I bought it. I first I thought it will be fake or a scam. It took long but the wait time was worth it. Other companies may have the same offer but they could be fake but these are really 100% real. Don’t buy it from other retailers. Legit AirPods 3rd gen and it’s at a good price. Don’t worry this is real! It works 100% and there is nothing wrong with it. Enjoy but these when these offer won’t last long so I suggest buying these. Enjoy these offers until next time. Thank you Amazon!

10,"Got the Apple AirPods Gen 3 recently.  I like the improved sound the spatial awareness surround sound feature is nice.  I like that compared to the gen1, you can hear what is going on around you sound wise at the appropriate volumes.  The bass is rich, highs are good.  The controls work well, pods are well built of quality material.  Connectivity is good and does drop audio.I will say the only thing that I have a problem with the fit of the AirPods.  Unlike the gen 1 and 2 that just hangs well on my ears they’d seem a little loose.  When I smile I can feel them dislodging.  The smaller size makes it hard to handle if you have bigger hands.  While controls are responsive, depending on size of your hands it may be difficult to find the little indentation to control them.This model did not come with the wireless MagSafe charger case.  Spend the extra $10 to get that feature.  Definitely worth it.Looking back I would have gotten the AirPod pros 2 for a more secure fit.  But that is just me.

13,"These ones hurt my ears physically. I guess my ears are too small. So if you don’t have small ears then they should fit fine. I have sores on the ridges on my ears. Similar to getting new shoes and you have sores on your lower ankles. You have to break them in I guess?However the physical durability is outstanding! The bad news is they fell out of my case somehow. I don’t know how that happened as they magnetically connect to close. Lost them at work. I was able to track them and they in the gutter. It must have happened when I was loading my car up to leave. Found the next day. They were ran over BUT they still work! They still charge and the mute buttons work. Amazing! Even though I can’t use them because it’s just too painful. The size/shape doesn’t bother my teen. It still puzzles me how they got bumped out of the charging case and lost to begin with but thrilled it’s not a total loss.⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ for durability

20,"Excellently priced for the T12 earbuds. They have great sound on the listening end as well as by the person hearing you through them. The case has a nice translucent shell and tells the battery life when plugged in. They arrived pre-charged at 100%. The earbuds are comfortable in your ears and they have a lot of upgraded features like tap once to answer, tap twice to hang up, press and hold to reject calls, and so forth. They arrived quickly and came with a very simple instruction card. To connect to your device you just take the out of the case and connect to T12 in the Bluetooth setting on your device. No complaints. Would recommend.

Very lightweight. The battery life is amazing and charged fast. Also you can control calls,play,pause,volume super easy without reaching the phone. Bluetooth connection reach a considerable distance. I go anywhere in my house without losing connection. Easy set up for different types of ears and ages. Good and compact storage. Travel is a breeze with this. I like to see movies on personal devices and the sound you get from this is like in a theater. Very recommended product especially if you travel with kids. I use them doing exercises and running and don't fall from your ear. Definitely they are super versatile and very pretty. Work perfect on calls too. It's a must have.

22,"What a pleasant surprise to come across these HUIFU T12 wireless earbuds in white pearl iridescent color! The fit is ultra-comfortable because of the three adaptable silicone tip sizes. As soon as they are in my ears, they begin searching to pair with my devices.  The controls are easy to navigate. The audio quality is amazing and the bass is much richer than the other buds in my inventory. The case is super lightweight and has a LED indicator to display the percent charged. The price is a plus, especially for the number of available features, such as Bluetooth, long-life battery, crystal-clear sound, and waterproofness. They have become my go-to earbuds.

23,"I was a little skeptical about getting these because I recently lost my Apple AirPods these work really good and are equally as loud. The case is lighter than my AirPods and was super easy to pair. They fit really good inside my ears. I’m able to make calls and hear really good on them. They already came pre-charged and I’ve been using them for hours and haven’t had to recharge them the case shows how much Charge the left or the right one holds which is super useful for when you need to switch or recharge. Really good price for these would recommend!

24,"Literally, I prefer earbuds with soft ear tips. The comfort ergonomic design with 3 different sizes of soft ear cups make me ease and comfort to use it for many hours without any pain. The light weight and soft ear cups keep the earbuds stable and secure inside the ears and waterproof design also contribute to be an ideal companion for using during various physical activities. Very fast and stable Bluetooth connection, long battery life and deep powerful bass stereo sound with acceptable noise cancellation never regret me for choosing it. The touch functions are accurate and fantastic.

25,"The sound quality on these earbuds are solid and crisp, pretty much on par with earbuds from the major brand names but at a much more reasonable price.  The battery life is extensive and even when the charge runs out, the buds can be easily recharged by placing them inside a small stylish case that can be plugged in via usb-c.  The case itself snaps shut magnetically, displays the current charge percentage and has an overall well-thought-out design.  I also really like the fact that the buds automatically power on and power off when you take them out of and place them inside the case respectively.  Overall a solid set of wireless buds for my everyday listening needs.

26,"This review is about the audio features of the JBL Vibe Beam earbuds.I'm an audio engineer so audio quality is very important to me. As such, I use wired connections as much as possible to maintain the integrity of the audio signal.  However, many newer consumer-level products no longer have audio jacks, so I finally decided to invest in some wireless earbuds as a backup to the other earphones and headphones that I use.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I didn't foresee myself using this product very much, and since this is my first foray into wireless audio earphones, if they were just ok or they broke after a while, then I wouldn't feel too bad about the little money that I spent.  Also, I wanted to focus on finding wireless earbuds with excellent audio quality first as I already have an excellent high-end bluetooth earpiece for cell phone use, and I wouldn't be using this product as a bluetooth headset for my phone.After doing much research, I chose the JBL Vibe Beam's as they were at my price point, I'm familiar with JBL products, and I could reasonably expect that they were likely deliver the high audio quality that I've come to expect from JBL products.  In my research, I read reviews that complained about the harshness of the high end with high frequency instruments like cymbals or the lack of bass, so I was a bit concerned.When I received and started listening to my JBL Vibe Beams I understood what people were talking about.  However, to correct the issues, first, one must have a great fit of the earbuds in their ears.  I'm fortunate, in that with the medium tips that were already installed on the Vibe Beams, they made a snug fit in my ears right out of the box.  If you find that these earbuds do not fit well in your ears it might be worthwhile to invest in a separate set of variable sized earbud tips, or try tips from one of your other well-fitting earbuds, if you have them.  Once the earbuds were seated properly in my ear, that took care of the poor bass issue. (I have not worn them long-term so I can't speak to them falling out of my ear, as others have mentioned, but they seem to stay in pretty well.)For the misaligned frequency response issue, fortunately, the JBL Headphone app that you can install on your cell phone includes a ten-band graphic equalizer that you can use to make adjustments to the frequency response of your earbuds.  After listening to several of the reference tracks I use to check new audio equipment or my mixes against, I found that the only adjustments needed were carving out some of the upper midrange and making a very slight boost in the bottom end of the lower frequency spectrum.  I've included a screenshot of my EQ curve which I based on the Bass preset in the JBL app.  You can't tell as there is no dB scale on the side, but I needed to cut or boost by only 1-2 dB.  I find that my new EQ curve gives a more balanced frequency response than what came out of the box, and matches up well against the reference speaker system and headphones that I use for my audio mixing and mastering work.  I invite you to use my EQ curve as a starting point and adjust as sounds best to you.I also read reviews complaining about the apparent lack of volume of the Vibe Beams.  I connected the JBL's to several different sources (phone, computer, TV, MP3 player, etc.) and I found that the overall maximum volume (with limiter off) is relatively lower than wired speaker versions.  However, the input to the JBL's is relative to the maximum output of the source itself.  I found that the loudest level I could get came from my iPhone and the lowest level output came from my MP3 player (which probably doesn't offer much output anyway being a tiny portable unit).  As a comparison, I did a side-by-side test of the JBL's with my wife's AirPods (2nd gen).  What I found was that the JBL's offered an almost identical audio output level as the AirPods with any of the sources I used so that confirmed that the output level of the JBL's has more to do with the source (and the source material as some songs are mastered at a lower volume than other songs) than with the earbuds themselves.  During my test, I put the JBL's at their maximum volume output (one tap at a time on the left bud to raise the volume).  Also, I noticed during my testing that the AirPods had a pleasing midrange sound perfect for listening to podcasts or watching video, but the JBL's excelled at full-range sound on the bottom and top ends of the frequency spectrum which made them sound much better over all and well-suited for music or listening to explosive action scenes in movies.And speaking of movies, the JBL app has a switchable audio/video mode.  The video mode reduces the latency of the delivery of audio against picture, so there isn't a noticeable lip-sync issue with dialogue in a scene.  However, there is a slight degradation in the audio quality of 'video' mode versus 'audio' mode, but you will have to make the determination if the change in audio quality is acceptable to you.As a side note, I included a picture of the inner side of the earbuds.  The 'L' and 'R' designations on the earbuds are tiny as you can see, plus they are the same color as the earbuds themselves, so they are very hard to see.  I wish JBL had made the L/R letters bigger or at least made them a different color so they would be easier to see.The pairing process was fairly easy with all my bluetooth-capable devices and the range was good, only dropping out after walking approximately 60-70 feet from the source.  There was one momentary dropout during my listening but that could be due to my wife using her AirPods the same time as I was using the JBL's.I can't speak to the other features of the JBL Vibe Beams as I don't intend to use them, but as far as audio quality goes, with just a few minor tweaks, these bluetooth earbuds can go from sounding like a $50 pair of earbuds to a $500 pair of reference earphones.

27,"Me: Ooo. Look at this deal…Also me: That’s really cheap. They’re probably trashMe: But they’re JBLs… They can’t be that bad.Also me: But they’re really cheap…Me: But they’re JBLs….All kidding aside, I was extremely surprised with these ear buds. I have an old pair of JBL Endurance Peak ONES and I’ve used them so much, they have started falling apart. I was apprehensive about these Vibes because they are so affordable, but my gosh. They sound just as good as my older JBL EPs, without the weight.They’re very easy to set up. Very comfortable. I like the matte black finish on the ones I got. One thing that also caused some apprehension when the prospect of the JBL app on my phone… I don’t particularly like installing programs I don’t NEED (and you really don’t need it for the buds to function) but this app comes with an equalizer - that works. You’ll have to play around with it to get it just right for your tastes, but it works.For the price, you can not go wrong with these ear buds.Update: It’s been almost a month with these buds, and I’m still thrilled. I use them while doing yard work, specifically weed whacking and pressure washing, and they block enough of the sound while providing excellent volume. I live in Florida, so I get really sweaty working. These things haven’t had any issue with moisture, even mist from pressure washing.My only complaint, and it’s not really the bud’s fault, is they slip out of my ears if I’m moving around a lot, but it does take a while. I’ve always needed bigger tips, so I can’t fault the buds.

28,"These are good quality and sound is good. I use them mainly for listening to books, podcasts and music while doing chores around the house. They are comfortable enough and have good range. They hold a charge for a significant amount of time. The only thing I dont like is the ambient noise feature. I was able to turn that function off, while I am using them to listen to music, audiobooks and podcasts, but have not found a way to turn it off during phone calls. I find it very annoying and distracting and for me it affects the quality of sound. Luckily, I rarely use them for phone conversations. I would purchase these again, just a model without the ambient feature. Oh, and I did accidentally leave the ear buds in case in my jeans pocket and put them in laundry washer, I realized about 15 to 20 minutes into wash and removed them, they were completely soaked, I put them in rice for 24 hours and they were good as new, thank goodness!

They’re actually really good.I have a little JBL speaker I got from a 2013 white elephant gift, which has outlasted my Bose products, so I do like the company.

I just got them today and when they arrived they were on 64% and I’ve been using one earbud for 4 hours and it’s now on 43% so the battery life is great!

Sound quality is not super great, the mids and highs are all you hear so they sound ok for an audio book but not great with music. The battery life is what you expect. But only a month after buying them they will only auto connect to my phone when I pulled them out of the case about 25% of the time the rest of the time I have to go into settings and manually connect them. And now they’ve gotten to where when I get it to say they’re connected, it makes the chime in the earbud like it is but zero sound or anything comes through either of the earbuds and I’m at the point where I have to go through customer support center to try to do something with it what a pain.

40,"Lost my AirPods and had to find a quick replacement . These were the next at bat . These are subpar compared to the AirPods.The case is cheap plastic that doesn't show a led charging light . So the only way you know if they are ready is if you open your phone to see battery percentage.A lot of jumbling around to fit them back into the case and in your ears correctly..The fit is ok but you cannot go to sleep in them since they aren't flush to the ear .The sound quality is rich on bass but the clarity almost sounds like a ft call without speakerphone . Value is great and the noise cancellation is EXCELLENT but just know they are inferior to the 🍎 ones

43,"My son is happy with these! The only downside is how they were packaged. They were shipped in a larger box with no bubble wrap, no styrofoam, no safety packaging to prevent damage in transit. Just the box of merch placed in a larger box with nothing else. Very weird. Thankfully they didn’t arrive damaged. But do better

45,"The Beats Solo Buds fall short of expectations, offering subpar performance that doesn't justify their price tag. I am returning these. These earbuds should be priced no higher than $50 given their significant limitations. Sound quality is the most disappointing aspect of the Solo Buds. While Beats has delivered impressive audio in some of their higher-end models, they've clearly cut corners here. The bass lacks depth and punch, while the mids and highs sound muddy and lack clarity. Even with Spatial Audio enabled on compatible tracks, the overall audio experience remains underwhelming.Another major drawback is the Solo Buds' limited functionality. Unlike many competitors in this price range, these earbuds lack active noise cancellation, transparency mode, and wear detection. The absence of these features, which are increasingly common even in budget earbuds, severely hampers their versatility and user experience.Volume is another area where the Solo Buds struggle. Even at maximum settings, they fail to deliver sufficient loudness for many listening environments. This inadequacy is particularly noticeable in noisier settings like gyms or public transportation, where users may find themselves straining to hear their audio content.The physical controls on the Solo Buds are also problematic. The buttons are uncomfortable to press and can cause discomfort when used frequently. This poor design choice further detracts from the overall user experience. While the Solo Buds do offer some positives, such as a compact design and decent battery life, these advantages are overshadowed by their fundamental shortcomings in sound quality and functionality.

46,"It works very well. Has a more stable Bluetooth connection than my Bose 700 or my Sony wh1000xm5. It has no ANC but it’s $100 so that’s expected. Use the appropriate silicone ear insert for proper noise isolation and you’ll barely hear the outside world. Sound quality isn’t great at lower volumes but at higher volumes it’s decent. The case is incredibly small and easy to pocket and I find when going out I grab these instead of my other two headphones.

49,"I paid $25 for these wireless buds, so I wasn't expecting much, but I gotta tell you these things are amazing for the price. To be honest I can't find a fault with them.Are they as good as Airpods?They are very close, sound quality is very good, fit and finish is very good, playback time is very good, charging time is very good and they have volume control which is rare on Bluetooth buds. They also instantly pair up.At this price range you can't find a better Bluetooth bud, trust me, I have a drawer full of crappy $25 buds.Great job Yobola, you gave us a very, very good product at the same price it costs to get two combo meals at a fast food restaurant.I am very pleased with these buds, wish I could leave more than five stars.Update: it is August 2024,These buds are still working great, I use them everyday at work. Battery in them still holds a good charge.

50,"I have had these wireless earbuds for a few months now and they are still going strong! They look just like AirPods and have great sound insulation. The battery lasts for about 15-20 hours of listening - GREAT battery life - and charge very quickly. I am actually on my second pair of these earbuds because the first ones got quieter and quieter over time - I had them for about a year - and eventually could barely hear them. That very well might be user error though (water, dirt, etc). Would highly recommend.

54,"I bought these primarily for the gym and overall I've really enjoyed them. The sound quality is decent, and unlike other earbuds I've tried, I don't have to repeatedly adjust back in place in my ear, and they don't hurt. The battery life on these is pretty great too, only once did I ever fully run out of battery and that was because I was purposefully testing the battery life.Unfortunately in the past few weeks they've begun to have some malfunctions. When I return the earbuds to their case, often times it seems like one of both of them don't recognize that they are back in the case and they don't turn off and I've been unable to find a way to manually turn them off so far. I end up having to fiddle with my phone Bluetooth settings until they disconnect, but the earbuds often times are still on and draining their battery and if they're nearby my phone they'll often reconnect on their own and cause me to miss notifications or calls because the audio is playing on the earbuds when I don't want it to.Unfortunately it's looking like I'm gonna have to retire these because, while they still work, this issue means that the battery is almost constantly draining and I always have to make sure they haven't connected to my phone on their own.

55,"My first pair of these lasted quite a while.  That wouldn't be impressive, except that the price point on these is so good.  I love these earbuds, so when the first pair I bought eventually seemed not to produce much volume anymore, I bought a replacement pair.There was some oddness trying to get the second pair to pair to my phone, probably because it still remembered the old pair.  But since they synced up, these have been working great!  No volume troubles.  I will buy a third pair when/if my new ones ever go out.

I had to redo this entire review. I checked and I have had these less than 5 months and the left earbud is useless. The return window closed February 2, 2024, the reason I am posting this is to inform others.When these work they are nice, but they don’t work in tandem well for long. A month ago I noticed that the left earbud, the volume was so low you could barely hear it, like someone is whispering in your ear, even at full volume. It’s such a marked difference I can’t even use them together anymore, it throws off the entire experience. The right ear bud is still going like a champ. Probably going to toss the left earbud since it’s useless now.I refuse to pay the price Apple wants for their earbuds, they’re not that good, I do love raycon though, they’re worth it! I do like to keep my nicer Raycons and a few pair of cheaper earbuds to use if others are charging, so I bought these.The pros? They have a nice charge case that charges both earbuds to full from being dead several times and they pair easily. That’s where the good news stops.The cons? If you don’t mind only having one earbud after less than 5 months of use, they’re the ones for you! I kid you not, save your money, buy some Raycons. If you desperately need a pair until you can get Raycons? Go on Temu, spend a third of this price and buy some to use. I am not joking when I say that I have earbuds I bought on Temu that still work more consistently than this pair has.Don’t buy these!

Conforme à sa description technique, la connexion est fluide ( appairage facile avec l'ensemble des devises tels que mes portables ( Samsung S21Fe, Samsung S10 et iPhones 8 et 13), mon pc portable et ma tablette. Je ne m'en sépare plus et suis très satisfaite de mon achat que j'en ai acheté pour offrir à mon entourage.J'adore son design car malgré l'utilisation excessive, je n'ai pas mal aux oreilles à la longue, ils sont bien conçus pour un usage longue au quotidien.

62,"These Wireless Earbuds are fantastic! The sound quality is exceptional, with deep bass and crystal-clear audio. The noise-cancelling mic ensures clear calls, and the LED display is super handy. They fit comfortably and securely, perfect for workouts, and the IP7 waterproof rating is a bonus! Unlike my AirPods which are muffled because I had them in my ear while showering. With 36 hours of playtime, I rarely need to recharge. Plus, the stylish rose gold color makes them even better. Highly recommend these earbuds for anyone looking for quality and convenience!

65,"I purchased these earbuds to replace an older set I had from a competitor.  Honestly, the digital LED display pretty much sold me on this pair.  It's always nice to know when you are running low on power.  More importantly, the ear pieces fit snug into my ears and they do not fall out when I am working on projects.  It is great to listen to music (and even talk on the phone) without worrying about losing an ear piece.  And the stereo sound is solid.This was well worth the purchase.  I would buy these again.

66,"Let me start by saying these ear buds sound amazing for what It cost to purchase. The earbuds came in a nicely packaged (small) box with instructions, USB-A to USB-C charging cable and 3 extra sets of silicone tips. The instructions to follow to connect to my iPhone 15 are straight forward. Open the case and my phone discovered it. I connected with no issues. As a side note: you can only connect to one device at a time. You will need to disconnect from the current device to connect to another... just a minor inconvenience. That said, I can’t imagine the clarity of my music and podcasts and MS Teams meetings getting any better. The mic seems to pick up well. As far as sound quality goes, the bass in the low end sounds great, and the high ends are crisp. I’ve worked out with them in a few times now, they are and feel small, lightweight and fits perfectly. Not once did I feel like they were going to fall out of my ear. I’ve used the AirPods previously and I would say these buds are a close second. The case is small and fits in a pocket with no issues (does not feel bulky). The digital display is easy to read. I would almost say it’s a perfect way of displaying the state of charge of the case/ earbuds. The only gripe I have are around the case. The texture of the body is smooth. I'm worried about the case slipping out of my hand and dropping it which I'm sure I will. The build quality of the case seems okay, the part that opens to reveal the earbuds seem a bit flimsy. There is next to no retention, meaning,  a slight touch will close the top. The issues I have are mainly around the case, which is important to know because the case plays a pretty important role in the overall functionality of the earbuds. These are budget friendly earbuds, but they deliver. I'm not going to comment on the durability at this point since I havent had much time with it. To be honest, if I can get a good year to a year and half of use, I would be happy and would purchase again.

76,"I love these earbuds. I personally hate the airpod style buds with the piece of silicone that sort of suctions into your ear. These give great sound and have a long lasting battery. I haven't had any connectivity issues and the JBL app is pretty helpful. You can set touch responses to whatever you'd like, which was the one thing I thought I'd miss about the airpods. They come with different ear tip sizes, so you can pick the size that's most comfortable for you.They also go on a pretty good sale from time to time, so keep an eye out. Still absolutely worth it at full price, though.

77,"I bought these JBL Tune Flexes as a replacement for a pair of JBL Vibe Flexes I lost.  There are more options on it than the Vibe Flex, which are nice.  The noise cancelling is not that effective with the open ear bud tips in.  They might work better with the isolation tips.  But I generally don't like isolation tips.They stay in my ear pretty well, and they have good sound.The touch controls are a little ""touchy,"" in that they activate when I don't intend to activate them.  I deducted one star for that.  Other than that, they have been a good pair of ear buds.  Certainly a good value when I found them on sale.Battery life is good.  I can listen just about all day at work before charging from the case.  I haven't figured out how long the case battery lasts.  I recharge it maybe once a week.

78,"I’ve only had them a couple days, bought as an economic fill in until my Bose EarPods get replaced. Set up was easy, the fit is light and comfortable. Call quality is great and tap functions are plentiful and work well. I also like that you can use left or right individually.Now the “bad”: the app doesn’t function most of the time (so far) and didn’t find the headphones when I open the app. Sound quality is ok with music, I tried a couple genres. The lows fall flat but otherwise it’s a nice sound. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being my Bose QC ultra and gen 1 AirPods being about a 4) these are about a 6.5. Additionally they do not charge wirelessly,  which I feel is an industry standard these days.I got mine for $50 (on sale?) and they’re definitely great at that price, not sure I’d feel the same at full price.

79,"The audio quality on these earbuds is unbelievable. Its seriously great.They also have an (optional) easy to use app that you can download onto your phone for more customization of the earbuds. You can change up the controls, like what happens if you tap the left ear bud once, or twice, etc... The app also has a pretty good equalizer with several different settings to choose from, or you can do a completely custom setting. I like lots of bass, so I set it to that preset and... wow! I didn't think it was possible to get that much bass (and overall sound quality) from a pair of earbuds. While its not as good as my Skullcandy Crusher over-the-ear headphones, it isn't that far off either.I only have 1 complaint about these earbuds and its something that I saw from another reviewer and I noticed the same thing as well. The size. They're large - at least the part that goes into your ear. Overall they seem like standard sized earbuds but they do have a tendency to come loose or fall out of my ears. Maybe they aren't larger than normal and its just the shape. I don't know, but I have noticed that these don't stay put as well as some others that I've used in the past. That said the audio quality of these makes up for that so its just a minor concern for me.

Unfortunately, lately there have been sudden interruptions in the sound for a couple of seconds, which is sometimes annoying. Also, with time of use, the volume in the earphones weakens, which is generally normal. The battery holds a charge just as well. Good bass and clear sound, I think this is one of the most successful models of in-ear headphones in the last couple of years.

86,"I have been through at least 6 earbuds already, trying to get one that basically does everything I need!  I work at home and was looking for earbuds that check off all the boxes I need!  So here is my take on these... SO far.  I will write a follow up IF need be:1.  VOICE AND MUSIC:  First and foremost, I need buds that actually work WELL with voice.  So far, I can hear my customers well (and I have hearing loss), and amazingly they can actually hear me well! As far as music, they sound fine to me.  No, they are not top of the line but for the average person they are absolutely fine.  Even nice.  One thing though, I have an equalizer on my phone for a nice deeper bass sound.  I had to turn that off.  At first I thought these buds were awful or broken, but as soon as I shut off the equalizer the sound came in very clear.  Best bass?...  no, but certainly good enough.2.  DISTANCE away from the PC.  All my others either lost connection or started breaking up as soon as I stepped away from the PC.  With these, I can walk around most of my apartment (albeit a fairly small apartment).  If I go into the garage or the far bedroom  I will lose connection but I can live with that.  Rarely go in there during the day while working.3.  CONNECTIVITY.... so far they have not disconnected while talking at my desk.  No breaking up either.4.  PAIRING... AMAZING.  They came fully charged, and paired with my PC in a flash.  But what I really LOVE about these is IF I do step too far and get a ""disconnected"" prompt, BUT the second I get within a close enough distance they reconnect on their own!  For all the others I have had so far, I have had to get back to my desk and re-pair the buds!  This is awesome for me.5.  FIT:  Wonderful for me, with very small ear canals!  Never had that before. All others fell out way too often, even causing me to lose one on a walk.  I did have to change to the smallest accessory silicone pieces for the ear canal, but they have fit fantastically and have not fallen out on their own once so far!CONS:  The only negative comment I have at all is definitely NOT a deal breaker.  They are slippery (not in a liquid sense) getting in and out of the case.  They want to run away.  LOLSUMMARY:  If you are looking for nice earbuds that do the job pretty darn close to the very expensive ones, try these!  I believe you will be happy you did not put out the big bucks.  For the record, I have returned $200+ earbuds because they did work as I expected, but these do!  Great Product... NOW we will see how they last.

91,"I recently purchased the Wireless Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.3, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in several ways.Sound Quality: The bass stereo sound is impressive, delivering deep and rich audio that enhances my music and podcast listening experience. The sound is clear and well-balanced, making these earbuds a joy to use.Noise Cancelling Mic: The noise-cancelling feature on the mic works exceptionally well. It effectively reduces background noise during calls, ensuring that my voice comes through clearly even in noisy environments.Battery Life: With up to 36 hours of playtime, these earbuds are perfect for long trips or extended use throughout the day. The LED display on the case is a handy feature, allowing me to easily check the battery level at a glance.Waterproof: The IP7 waterproof rating gives me peace of mind when using the earbuds during workouts or in rainy weather. They have held up well against sweat and moisture.Comfort and Fit: The in-ear design is comfortable and secure, even during extended use. They fit snugly without causing any discomfort, making them ideal for both casual listening and active use.Connectivity: The Bluetooth 5.3 technology ensures a stable and fast connection with my devices. Pairing is quick and hassle-free, and I haven’t experienced any dropouts or connectivity issues.Overall, these Wireless Earbuds offer excellent value for their price. They combine great sound quality, long battery life, and useful features like noise cancelling and waterproofing, making them a fantastic choice for anyone in need of reliable and high-quality earphones.

92,"I was skeptical about buying another 20$ pair of earbuds vs just buying a more expensive pair. Most of my luck the 20$ ones are shot after a week or so after using in the construction field 10hrs a day. So far these have been impressive great sound , great bass, and last me 8 hours without charging the ear buds. I take them out at lunch give them a quick charge and they last me the full 10hr day. Very responsive to the Bluetooth connection. Seem pretty decent for answering calls most of the time it’s too noise for them to hear me but when I get the ability to use them for calls they work great. Great for noise cancellation also.

Premetto che le ho pagate 19,90.Per quel prezzo sono davvero ottime e mi sono preso qualche mese prima di recensirle.Ecco i alcuni punti che le rendono ottime.Ergonomia.Sono davvero comode, perché hanno la forma e la dimensione adatta per l'orecchio. Dispongono dei gommini di varie dimensioni e non cadono accidentalmente.Facilità d'uso,Si connettono con molta facilità al telefono sia android che Apple. Hanno varie funzioni di attivazione e regolazione del volume tramite il tocco nella parte bassa dell'auricolare.Qualità audio.La qualità e il volume sonoro è davvero ottimo ed è paragonabile a quello degli auricolari più famosi.Durata batterieLa durata delle batterie supera le 4 ore per gli auricolari e quella della scatolina non sono riuscito a misurarla.Il fatto che si ricarichino wireless appena le si inseriscono nella scatolina e il fatto che venga indicata la carica è davvero ottima.In conclusioneVisto il prezzo e la qualità degli auricolari, mi sento di consigliarle.

96,"Los auriculares son muy cómodos, el estuche viene con una pantalla que te indica el porcentaje de batería e incluso lo que está cargando un auricular y el otro. La tapa funciona con imán y se cierra perfectamente. Los materiales son bastante buenos y puedes escoger también las gomas para adaptar los auriculares a tus oídos. El sonido es muy bueno para el precio que tienen, sobre todo si te gustan los graves, aunque puedes usar siempre el ecualizador de la aplicación que uses para aumentar la calidad o configurar los auriculares a tu gusto. La verdad es que son fantásticos.

97,"Ich habe zeitgleich mit diesen Kopfhörern ein Paar Apple AirPods geliehen bekommen, so dass ich den direkten Vergleich hatte. Mein persönlicher Eindruck ist, dass an den Sound der AirPods nichts heran kommt - kristallklar und die Bässe wunderbar akzentuiert, nicht zu viel und nicht zu wenig. Im direkten Vergleich schwächeln die Bässe der Btooto Kopfhörer ein wenig, deshalb einen halben Stern Abzug, aber dennoch ist der Sound wirklich gut! Ohne den Vergleich wird man wahrscheinlich gar nichts zu beanstanden haben.Ich habe beide Paare auf einer längeren Fahrradfahrt getestet, da ich mehrfach in der Woche eine Strecke von ca. 40 Kilometern fahre und das langsam langweilig wird. Da es nichts Neues zu sehen gibt, wollte ich Entertainment wenigstens auf den Ohren. Bei der noch vorherrschenden Kälte bin ich mit Sturmhaube unterm Helm gefahren und beide Paare funktionierten problemlos, allerdings reagieren die Btootos auf Antippen nur, wenn die Finger die Sensoren berühren - durch Stoff, mit Handschuhen oder durch lange Haare geht es nicht. Dafür einen weiteren halben Stern Abzug, da die AirPods das hinbekommen.ABER, die Btootos haben wesentlich mehr Funktionen - Pause/Wiedergabe, Titel vor und zurück sowie leise oder lauter stellen ist hier alles an den Kopfhörern regulierbar. Die AirPods haben auf jeder Seite nur eine Funktion und zum Lautstärke regulieren muss man auf jeden Fall das Ursprungsgerät bedienen. Beim Radfahren super unpraktisch, da ich sowohl über Feld, durch Wald und an Straßen vorbei fahre, wo unterschiedliche Umgebungslautstärken herrschen. Da jedes Mal anhalten, absteigen und das Handy rauskramen zu müssen, geht gar nicht. Deshalb wieder einen halben Stern dazu. :-)Bisher haben sie sich immer problemlos automatisch mit dem Handy verbunden, Anrufe funktionieren, laden ist prima mit der Anzeige des Akkustands und sie sitzen fester in den Ohren als die AirPods aufgrund der Gummistöpsel. Habe da wohl die kleinste Größe wählen müssen, damit sie passen - für Leute mit sehr kleinen Ohren könnte es eng werden. Die Auswahl an Farben ist auch schön - ich hab das Altrosa und finde es chic.Fazit ist, dass ich mit diesen Gerät so zufrieden bin und sogar einige Vorteile sehe, dass ich beim besten Willen keinen Grund finde den horrenden Preis zu bezahlen, den Apple sich fragt. Da fängt der Spaß ja erst bei 150,-€ aufwärts an, während die Btootos keine 30,-€ kosten. Dafür definitiv nochmal einen halben Stern, so dass ich mit gutem Gewissen die fünf Sterne geben kann. Wie lange diese Geräte halten, wird sich zeigen. Möglicherweise zeigt sich da irgendwann, dass Apple den Preis zu Recht und nicht nur für den Namen verlangt, aber an dieser Stelle kann ich nur eine klare Kaufempfehlung aussprechen.

99,"I recently purchased the KTGEE Wireless Earbuds with Bluetooth 5.3, and after using them for a few weeks, I feel comfortable comparing them to my previous pair of Apple AirPods. While AirPods are often the go-to for seamless iOS integration, I was impressed with how the KTGEE earbuds hold their own, especially considering the significant price difference.Sound Quality: KTGEE earbuds offer a rich and balanced sound, with a slightly heavier bass than AirPods, which is great for listening to music. While AirPods have a more neutral sound profile that works well across different genres, I find KTGEE's sound signature to be warmer and more enjoyable for casual listening. However, if you're a fan of high-fidelity audio, the AirPods still have the edge with more clarity in the mids and highs.Comfort and Fit: Both sets of earbuds are lightweight, but KTGEE comes with multiple ear tip sizes, allowing for a more customizable fit. I find them to be more secure during workouts than my AirPods, which tend to slip out during high-intensity activities. If comfort and fit during exercise are priorities, KTGEE is the better choice.Battery Life: KTGEE advertises around 6-7 hours of battery life on a single charge, and in my experience, they do meet that mark. With the charging case, I’ve been able to use them throughout the day without worrying about running out of juice. In comparison, AirPods have a similar battery life, though the wireless charging feature in the AirPods case is more convenient. The KTGEE case is slightly bulkier but not a dealbreaker.Bluetooth Connectivity: Both the KTGEE and AirPods utilize Bluetooth 5.3 and 5.0, respectively. KTGEE has quick pairing and stable connection with both iOS and Android devices. However, Apple AirPods do have a more seamless connection with Apple devices thanks to the H1 chip. The automatic switching between Apple devices, such as from an iPhone to a MacBook, is smoother with AirPods.Touch Controls and Features: The touch controls on the KTGEE earbuds are responsive but take a little getting used to compared to the intuitive tap commands on the AirPods. You can control music playback, adjust volume, and activate voice assistants with both, but AirPods' Siri integration is more fluid. However, KTGEE provides good basic functionality for the price.Durability and Design: While Apple AirPods feel more premium in terms of design and material, the KTGEE earbuds are surprisingly well-built. They are IPX7 rated, meaning they’re more water-resistant than the standard AirPods (IPX4), making them better suited for workouts or outdoor activities. The overall design is sleek, though slightly bulkier than AirPods.Price and Value: Here’s where the KTGEE earbuds really shine. At a fraction of the price of AirPods, they deliver solid performance, especially for those who don’t need the seamless Apple ecosystem integration. For anyone on a budget, or if you just want a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for everyday use, KTGEE is a fantastic value.Conclusion: While Apple AirPods have a smoother user experience with Apple devices and offer slightly better sound clarity, the KTGEE Wireless Earbuds are an excellent alternative, especially for the price. They provide great sound, longer battery life, and are more secure for active users. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option that doesn’t compromise too much on quality, KTGEE is definitely worth considering.

101,"I recently bought these wireless earbuds and they are surprisingly good in terms of build quality, weight and comfortability. These earbuds came fully charged and pairing them was so easy, no more pressing the on/off button for a few seconds to pair them with your phone that kind of nonsense anymore.  I believe even people who own their first pair of Bluetooth earbuds should be able to do it without any issues.  These T08 earbuds stay in my ears the whole time when I was walking around while making calls.  I even tried to shake my head while having them in my ears, they stay put!  The sound quality is also clear and great, I had no complaints from the person I talked to for over 3 hours on a call, we all heard each other loud and clear.  My ears also didn't feel hurt at all after that 3-hour call because they are very lightweight.The charging case is a big PLUS!  I like the LED display that shows the earbuds are being charged and the case is being charged.  That gives me a peace of mind that I can rely on them when I have to make a long call next time.In short, they are really comfortable, reliable and affordable.

Honestly I’m really happy with these headphones. The extra features that that come with the case are really handy. It gives me a whole bunch of useful information. Like the time, left and right battery life, case battery life, etc. These headphones also arrived pretty fast and was safely secured in the package. The noise cancellation was really surprising. I could feel the noise being blocked out of my ears. The transparency mode was also shocking. It felt like I could hear the smallest sounds. It was super easy to switch from transparency, noise cancellation, and normal audio.

115,"I was looking to replace a 2 year old pair of Beats - Powerbeats Pro.  I liked the Beats but was NOT willing to fork out $150+ for them in this economy.  These JBL headphones were on sale for $49.  Bought them.  First impression is they are really nice.  They sound exactly like the Powerbeats.  Only small gripe is they do fall out of my ear sometimes but it is not that big of a deal.  For the price, these are great earbuds.  5 star.

116,"I am not an earbud critic, but I know what I like and I like these a lot.After losing one of my old earbuds after meeting the founder of Culver's at the first Culver's Restaurant, a truly historic moment in my life, I was adrift.I liked my old earbuds and made a desperate call to the store to see if it had been found.  To my joy, they told me that it had been recovered, but my hopes were quickly dashed when they informed me that they couldn't mail it to me since I live out of state.I had flown too close to fast food greatness and had been burned as a result. Culver's is still great btw.Anyway, I found these earbuds while morosely scrolling through Amazon in an attempt to find the same brand and style that I had.These earbuds were on sale for $50, which seemed a bit much, but when I noticed they were 50% off I thought, why not?I had heard good things about JBL and these did not disappoint.  The value for the money I spent is fantastic. The built in mic is great for hands free calling, something that was always a challenge with my old ones.These have great battery life.  I charge them on Sundays and use them the whole week without issue. The Bluetooth connection is smooth and I love the range of features available with them.I can easily turn them to noise cancelling, ambient aware and talk through with a tap of my finger and it is equally as easy to switch tracks forward or back.I hope that I don't lose one of these as their loss would be far harder to bear.  Don't think about, buy these now! You won't regret it. Happy listening!

117,"Awesome buds. Superb sound quality. Awesome app with custom EQ settings. On default sound, the bass is boosted +4dB, so you don't really need Spotify's EQ settings to boost it further.A few minor things though. The case is bad quality. I literally had the case in my pocket with my phone against the phone's screen side and the case already has markings. From...smooth glass? The finish wears off too quickly. It's a matte coating and won't last so you'll need a case. Also, the earbuds seem to rely on staying in your ears 100% on the silicone tips being squeezed into your ears. There is nothing else providing stability. They do stay in my ears during my workouts, but they loosen over and over and it leads to decreased bass in my music until I readjust them.All in all, $50 is a pretty good price, but you'll need a $10 case. Even with a case, which most are made out of silicone, it'll wear off the matte finish over time. Don't expect the case to be nice after a year.

118,"My main pair of buds is my Google Pixel Bud Pros, but I recently left them at the office. Not knowing when i would be back, i decided to look for a reasonably priced back up pair. These JBL Tune Buds were on a 50% off sale and had plenty of positive reviews. Opted for the blue and am glad i did....the color is nice!One negative that came up in reviews is the fit, which made me a little nervous, as sometimes i have a hard time keeping buds in. I rolled the dice and am glad i did!These arrived on time, and well packaged. They did not include a USB-C cable (unless i missed it), but thats fine because we have a ton of those kicking around. They came shipped with a 60% charge on the case, and 100% charge on the buds, so I was able to test right away.Downloading the app was simple and it installed quickly. The interface is nicely laid out, and is reminiscent of other audio apps for buds with controls for noise cancelation, equalizer, and touch features. Simple to navigate and customize.The buds connected right away, and are quick to connect every time i remove them from the case. The sound is quite good, and I have yet to experiment with the EQ. I do wish they would go a little louder, but i think thats more a phone thing than the buds (my pixel 7 pro could use more volume). Touch controls work well, but the one omission i notice is the slide to change volume. I have this feature on my pixel buds, and really like being able to adjust the volume without needing to handle my phone. For the price, this is not a deal breaker. Some comments say the noise cancelation isnt the best. While that may be the case, it's still effective and i find it sufficient for my needs.Calls are clear for both myself and the other party. Voice come through clearly and is a nice call experience. Voice to text dictation works flawlessly.The buds charge quickly, as does the case, and I seem to get multiple charges to the buds (more than i get with my pixel buds) with one case charge.Overall, these were a great purchase and can easily see myself using these as my main buds if my pixel buds are ever lost or stop functioning.

119,"Comfortable in my ears! Fit well with the medium bud pieces. The design is fun and comfortable. The sound is phenomenal, used them while working a haunted house to block out some of the noise, and they were perfect. They’ve been dropped a few times and still work great. Quite durable! There’s been no problem with connecting to any of my devices. Love the purple a lot!

123,"I have 2 pairs of these buds.  Money was no object and I tried almost every brands and more expensive buds before selecting these buds.  The sub-bass is incredible.  Some other brands had also great sound but all were not loud enough, to my taste.  I use these buds while driving my harley and it lowers significantly my Harley exhaust sound and more importantly, the loud tire noise from adjacent cars on the higway.  It makes everything much quieter, relative to unwanted noise in your environment.  Unless you have small ears, I recommend using the biggest size Rubber/Silicone Ear Tips.  Definitly not recommended for running as they are a little heavy and fall easily.

124,"Amazing sound with high quality low-high drivers on these JBL's. Noise cancelling is best in class for these earbuds, and the pass-through mode for still hearing conversation with them in works very well.They last FOREVER. I work 12 hour shifts and can easily get through a shift with the bud in my right ear all day. Over my hour lunch break I put it back in the case and that charge is enough to get me through an entire day with no interruptions. In my experience the advertised 40 total hours of listening with the charging case is very accurate. I measured it at 38.5 hours with the volume set to about 80-85%. I'm sure you could easily get 40+ hours if using them at 50% volume.The charging case is great, feels very high quality. Charges wirelessly on a charging pad or with USBC input. Charges very quickly, roughly 1.5-2 hours for a full charge if you are charging them with a low volt charger as you are supposed to as not to damage the internal battery.*NOTE* please people, don't charge any of your earbuds of any brand with a 100 watt fast charger, you will damage the battery over time I promise.The JBL app is one of the best earbud companion apps I've used. It blows the BEATS app out of the water and is much better than the majority of its competition. You can change EQ, noise cancelling, and touch control programming quickly and easily.Speaking of touch controls, they are located on the stem of each bud and work very reliably in my experience. 1 tap for pause, 2 taps for skip ahead, 1 tap hold for voice assistant. 2 taps then hold on the 2nd tap for pairing mode. Haven't had any issues with accidental touches over the last 6+ months of using them every day.The sound profile is rich and deep, with these high quality drivers after Harmon kardon joined with JBL, they are much more well rounded than anything else in the 150 dollar range. Highs are crisp and satisfying and lows have a great little rumble without muddling the mids. Soundstage isnt too open like you get with some of the partial In ear designs but doesn't feel closed off and stuffy either. My father in law was an audio engineer in Hollywood for 40 years and worked for almost every major band under the sun as well as the Jimmy Kimmel show for many years, and when he tried these out on our last visit he was genuinely impressed. He is normally a Sony or Bose guy but expressed interest in buying a pair of these for around the house.As far as fitment goes, I go with the middle sized silicone tips and they work great for me. There are small, medium and large tips that come in the package. They are more comfortable than the beats I have and far more comfortable than my airpods pro. I can use them for 12 hours straight without ear fatigue. They are ported enough where they don't feel stuffy in my ears and don't make my ears itchy like most other buds do after only a couple of hours.Overall, I highly recommend these earbuds from JBL. They are the best value for money in this price range--bar none. I would take these all day everyday over my airpods pro and that's saying something as those are no slouch either. If you are on the fence about these, I'd advise you to just buy them and see for yourself. As someone who uses earbuds for 12 hours a day, 48 hours a week, these are my go-to buds and I've tried at least 20 other models from all the major brands.

125,"At time of writing Ive had these headphones about a year. These are my first set of TWS (true wireless stereo) headphones. I was hesitant to get this type of headphones thinking I would easily lose the earbud, but so far I have not. They do have the ability to play a chime if you are trying to find a misplaced earbud, which is nice (ive used this more than once)I find them to be very comfortable to wear, though I do get a bit of fatigue after a few hours and have to take them out for a bit. They stay pretty well put even when active (working out, cycling, etc)The noise cancelling is great. Cuts out the low frequency drone on planes and trains, background chatter at airports, etc; even without music playing. You do still hear people talking to you, but it muffles it significantly...if someone is trying to talk to me with the headphones in listening to music, it takes a minute for me to realize it. Wind buffeting is usually pretty minimal; I wear these headphones cycling and its usually not noticeable amount of buffeting.Im not an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is very good, and has good lows/bass for an earbud.Battery life is excellent. You can get probably 8 hours straight out of the headphones, but since the case charges them, if you take them out and put them in the case for a bit they will top off. I dont normally wear them until the battery dies, but Id say you can probably get 3 or 4 full charges from the case. Recharging the headphones is quick, and recharging the case itself is also quick (USB C). The earbuds self-locate (magnetically) into the case, so they quickly stow away and also dont just fall out when you open the case. The case has 3 led lights that indicate charge level of the case. The case lid feels a little flimsy, but so far it has held up fine.I disabled the tap actions of the headphones, but it does have the functionality and are customizable in the app. The app is pretty good and easy to use. With my iPhone, sometimes when i answer a call it does not use the headphones and i have to manually select that which is kind of annoying but not a deal breaker. Im sure the AirPods would be better integrated for answering calls.Not sure if they were on sale at the time I purchased them, but they were $100 at that time (fall 2023) and now are $150. Id say they are still a good deal even at the higher price, but they were an absolute BARGAIN at the price I bought them.

126,"Bought these (after much research) as a replacement for my Sony WF-1000XM3. The Sonys had excellent sound & class leading noise cancellation. But, I never loved the design. They never stayed in the ear properly, so I was looking for something in the hook design, like an AirPod.I spent some time comparing these JBLs to Apple AirPods. The reviews of these JBL earbuds suggested them as the best alternative to the AirPods. A sale, plus a coupon, and I got these JBLs on Amazon for $150, or about half the price of the AirPod 4 with ANC.In terms of performance & fit, the JBLs come as advertised. They are comfortable & crucially, they stay stable in my ear whilst walking.As for sound? They rate very well. I use the JBL app & tried a few sound profiles. What impressed me most was the bass performance.The noise cancellation initially left me wanting. I walked thru the train station for the first time with these (I have a hour daily commute) and the amount of noise leaking in was disappointing. But, I went into the settings and noticed the Adaptive Noise Cancelling wasn’t utilizing the full capability of the NC feature. So I turned off the “Adaptive” NC and manually set the NC to the maximum & the difference was noticeable.Now, the noise cancelling on these buds prob falls a bit short of Apple or Sony, but I’d guess you are getting about 80% of the NC at about half the price. All those low end rumbles are filtered out, making for a quiet commute for me.Some other points, I really like the case. It’s compact. It features wireless charging. Battery life for these buds is listed at 6 hours with ANC & the case gives you an additional 30hrs.If you are looking for a new set of earbuds, & don’t want to spend $300CDN, I’d highly recommend these buds.
